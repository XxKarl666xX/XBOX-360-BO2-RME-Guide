# XBOX-360-BO2-RME-Guide
A written guide on how to use RME on BO2 to make custom options. 
</br>
This text based guide is meant to teach in a very basic manner on how to create own RME options on BO2 with the already public sunset source.
</br>
The goal of this guide is to inspire hopefully others to make actually custom stuff for BO2 with RME. People havent done anything innovative or fun in the modding scene for so long, its time that this changes as the servers for the xbox 360 wont be online for that much longer. We need to do some cool stuff while we still can.
