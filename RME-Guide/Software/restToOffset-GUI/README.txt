how to use:
1. start restToOffset.exe
2. Input the offset that you want to have "restToOffset" from
3. Hit enter and get the result straight away


(optional)
look through the source code yourself before starting the .exe if you dont trust it. Nothing is encrypted or coded in a weird/sketchy way. If you still dont trust the .exe then just get the basic formula out of it and make such script yourself, its not hard.
The same goes for the .py as this is even easier to understand, its way easier to see that nothing malicious is beeing done at any point.


further proof that its nothing malicious:
